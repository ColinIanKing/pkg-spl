Description: The Solaris Porting Layer (SPL) for the Linux kernel.
 The Solaris Porting Layer (SPL) is a Linux kernel module which provides
 many of the Solaris kernel APIs. This shim layer makes it possible to
 run Solaris kernel code in the Linux kernel with relatively minimal
 modification.
 .
 This can be particularly useful when you want to track upstream Solaris
 development closely and don't want the overhead of maintaining a large
 patch which converts Solaris primitives to Linux primitives.
 .
 This package contains the source code for the SPL Linux kernel module,
 which can be used with DKMS, so that local kernel modules are automatically
 built and installed every time the kernel packages are upgraded.
